![alt text](./assets/view-cat.png)

This repository contains the official implementation of the BoVW-CAM code. This method is an equivalent to the Grad-CAM method, but it is specifically designed for classifiers based on keypoint features and Bag-of-Visual-Words. For a better understanding of the implementation details, please refer to the paper at: [Link](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-21689-3_4).

# Install

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Demo

You can find an example of usage in the "demo.ipynb" notebook. The current example was performed on a toy dataset, but I intend to update it with a state-of-the-art dataset as soon as possible.
